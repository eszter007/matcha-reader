namespace {
// v28: text decoration bits now include line-through in serialized wordStyles.
// v29: TextBlock word data stored as one flat arena (offset table + NUL-terminated
// text blob) instead of length-prefixed strings and per-field arrays.
// v30: Arabic shaping changed both drawing and measurement (getTextAdvanceX now
//      measures the shaped visual text); cached word positions from v29 no longer
//      match what drawText renders.
// v32: ImageBlock serializes the book-internal source href after the cache path
//      (lazy extraction: images are header-probed at build time and extracted on
//      first render).
// v33: Support <ruby> and <rt> tags. Skip <rp> tags
// -- fork versions continue above upstream's numbering --
// v46: "Book side margins" setting (honor vs ignore book CSS horizontal insets) is a layout
// input; it joins the header match params and widens the header by one bool.
// v47: text-emphasis (bouten as synthetic ruby), small-caps transform, and
// list-style-type markers change parsed section content.
// v48: gaiji inline images emit replacement text instead of image blocks.
// v49: CSS cache v12 parses per-side borders + font shorthand; sections built
// against v11 rules lack those edges/styles.
// v50: force re-parse so the furigana glossary (ruby.bin) harvests existing books.
// v51: merge of upstream 1.5.0 -- arena TextBlock, ruby group distribution, lazy image
// extraction and the incremental/partial build format all land at once.
// v52: images whose build-time extraction failed are laid out with a recoverable ImageBlock
// instead of being dropped to alt text. The byte layout is unchanged -- the bump exists to
// rebuild caches that recorded the drop, which no amount of re-rendering can undo.
// v53: aspect-mismatched images are fitted upright rather than marked rotated. A v52 cache has
// their natural dimensions baked into the block, which render() rejects as out of bounds, so
// those pages must be re-laid-out to become visible.
// v54: render() implements rotation, so those images go back to being stored rotated (natural
// dims, fitted in the rotated frame at draw time) and fill the screen again. v53 caches hold the
// upright fit and would keep showing the small version.
// v55: ImageBlock serializes `rotated` + reserveMargin_. They were never persisted, so a cached
// rotated image loaded as unrotated-with-natural-dims and drew nothing at all.
// v56: ruby lines no longer get the ruby shift baked into their cached y (render applies it),
// which was collapsing the leading after every furigana-carrying line.
// v57: bouten marks carry an ideographic space per mark so the SUP-scaled ruby run matches the
// width of the text it marks; without it the marks bunched into the middle at half width.
// v58: CSS font-size is honoured, so every TextBlock stores the font id it was laid out with
// (BlockStyle::fontId, 4 bytes after directionDefined). A v57 record has neither the field nor
// the heading-sized line positions.
// v59: CSS color/background-color become an ink mode. Every TextBlock stores it (2 bytes after
// fontId) and every PageBox stores a fill flag, so a v58 record is one byte short per box and
// mis-frames the block that follows; inverted blocks also gain a panel element a v58 page lacks.
// v60: CSS page-break-{before,after,inside} are honoured, so blocks land on different pages than
// a v59 build put them on. The byte layout is unchanged -- the bump exists because the PAGINATION
// changed, and a cached section would otherwise keep showing chapters running together.
// v61: descendant (`.callout p`) and child (`blockquote > p`) selectors match, so rules that
// were dropped for the whole life of this engine now apply -- different fonts, spacing,
// alignment and page breaks than a v60 build laid out. The byte layout is unchanged; the bump
// exists because a cached section would otherwise keep showing the unstyled result.
// v62: CSS line-height scales each block's leading, so every line after the first styled block
// sits at a different y. The byte layout is unchanged (the leading is consumed during the build
// and what is stored is the resulting positions); the bump exists because a v61 section would
// keep drawing the old spacing forever.
// v63: CSS text-transform and hyphens:none change laid-out words and line breaks; letter-spacing
// changes every tracked word position and adds one serialized byte to BlockStyle.
// v64: the PageBox border byte now packs dotted/dashed style and thickness, bottom-only borders
// are emitted at element close, and inline-block heading rules shrink to their content.
// v65: partial-border spacing now collapses adjacent vertical margins instead of adding the
// full-box clearance after headings, quotes and empty worksheet rules.
// v66: Word gaps are only suppressed for tokens glued in the source, so spaces between
//      Hangul words survive again; ruby element boundaries carry the continuation flag
//      instead.
// v67: <br> handling changed layout — a <br> after text is now a margin-stripped
//      line break (browser-like) and only a <br> whose block stays empty injects
//      the scene-break gap, so cached pages laid out by older versions no longer
//      match. Keeps <br>-per-paragraph books (common CJK formatting) from
//      re-adding container spacing at every paragraph.
// v68: aside/section/article/figure/figcaption became block tags, so their block CSS
//      (margins, padding, text-align, borders -- e.g. <aside class="box"> call-out frames)
//      now lays out. Byte layout unchanged; a v67 section was built without those boxes
//      and would keep rendering unframed forever.
// v69: TextBlock gained an optional per-word font array (inline font-size on spans) -- the
//      arena layout and its flags byte changed, so a v68 arena mis-parses under v69 framing.
//      ol/ul and td/th also route their block CSS through fromCssStyle now, and sup/sub
//      forward their tags' own font-style/weight, all of which move cached word positions.
// v70: upstream merge (their v35): the header gains a fifth uint32 offset and every page
//      records its visible-text start offset in a per-page LUT (content-based positions).
// v71: upstream merge (their v36): ruby start/end overhang reservation moved into
//      calculateRubyExtraStartOffset/EndOffset, which no longer let the adjacent word absorb
//      the overhang -- that word is on the neighbouring LINE and cannot. Line breaks move, so
//      cached pages laid out by v70 no longer match.
// v72: no format change -- CssPropertyFlags::anySet() omitted `border`, so every border-only
//      rule was discarded before it was stored and no bordered block ever picked up its edges.
//      Cached pages were laid out without those borders.
// v73: the header records whether furigana is on, and a ruby-carrying line only reserves the
//      leading its annotation needs when it is. With furigana off, pages now hold more lines,
//      so the toggle re-lays the chapter out instead of only suppressing the annotations.
// v74: a negative text-indent is bounded by the left inset in force. A hanging indent whose
//      paired margin-left was dropped (Book Margins off) drew the first line off the left edge
//      of the screen with its first character clipped; cached pages hold those positions.
// v75: a font-size on <html>/<body> is ignored -- it restates the base size, which IS the
//      reader's own font here, so honouring it sized whole books off the user's setting.
//      Cached pages hold the shrunken layout and its line positions.
// v76: upstream merge (their v37): FootnoteEntry::href grew from 96 to 256 bytes for long
//      calibre paths, so every cached footnote record shifts by 160 bytes and a v75 file
//      mis-parses under v76 framing.
// v77: upstream merge (their v38): Focus Reading line breaking changed — a visible hyphen/dash inside a word is now a
//      break opportunity, and hyphenation of a focus-split word considers the whole word
//      instead of only its regular-weight suffix. Pages cached by older versions were laid
//      out with the previous, more restrictive break set and no longer match.
// v78: upstream merge (their v39): image top margin is clamped so a full-viewport-height
//      image cannot overflow the page bottom; older caches can hold placements that panels
//      with no bottom inset refuse to draw.
// v79: upstream merge (their v40): a group ruby no longer allows a break inside it
//      (wordNoSpaceBefore cleared) and a text block no longer soft-flushes while the
//      parser is inside <ruby>. Both change where lines break, so pages cached by
//      older versions no longer match.
