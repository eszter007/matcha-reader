# Built-in font generation

Install `requirements.txt` in a Python environment, then run
`bash convert-builtin-fonts.sh` with that environment active. Source fonts are
under `../builtinFonts/source/`. Generated built-in headers are checked in. The Joyo CJK
headers (`notosansjp_joyo_*`) are not produced by this script; it only dedupes
their tables.
Their source font is not in the repository. To change their group sizes, run
`python regroup_font_header.py ../builtinFonts/notosansjp_joyo_*_regular.h`; it
regroups the existing headers with the caps from `fontconvert.py`.

Reader and CJK fonts use row-aligned 2-bit DEFLATE groups. The Ubuntu UI fonts retain
their packed 1-bit pixels inside DEFLATE groups capped at 4 KiB. The firmware
uses its existing hot-group buffer for these UI fonts; they do not occupy the
four reader prewarm slots. Allocation failure skips the glyph and logs an error.

The conversion script finishes by running `dedupe_font_tables.py` and
`verify_compression.py`. Deduplication moves identical lookup arrays into
`SharedFontTables.h`; glyph metrics and size-dependent kerning values remain
unchanged. Shared names derive from table contents. Individual font headers
include the shared header, so they can still be included independently.

After converting a single font, rerun both scripts against `../builtinFonts/`.
Deduplication supports partial regeneration and repeated runs. Do not edit the
generated shared header directly.

Host checks are `python test/test_dedupe_font_tables.py` from the repository
root and the CMake `FontDecompressorTest` target. The latter compares every UI
glyph against hashes of the original bitmap bytes and checks allocation failure,
reader prewarming, and the UI group allocation bound.
